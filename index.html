            under mezzo-soprano Elizabeth Turnbull and with collaborative
            pianist Shannon Hiebert. While at the University of Alberta, she
            performed multiple solo concerts, featured in many operas and
            operettas, travelled and sung with the Madrigal Singers Choir under
            the direction of Leonard Ratzlaff at Koerner Hall in Toronto as well
            as the Winspear Centre in Edmonton. Along with her studies in
            Edmonton, she also attended summer opera festivals including the
            Halifax Summer Opera Festival, the Yorkshire Opera Festival in
            England, and the Centre for Opera Studies in Italy.
